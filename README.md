Figure 4 is code for clustered heatmaps for all positive and negative mode LCMS data. 

Figure 5 is code for box plots with concentraitons of four pharmaceutical analytes. 

Figure 6 is code for box plots of annotations from molecular network of transformation products with Kruskal Wallis and Dunn's post hoc non-parametric tests. 

Figure 7 is code for box plots of all inorganic analytes in study with Kruskal Wallis and Dunn's post hoc test.
